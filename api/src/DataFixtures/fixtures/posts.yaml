    June. However, the COVID-19 global pandemic is no doubt having an abnormal effect on routine in 2020. Alex Jebailey,
    the tournament organizer behind CEO, has taken to Twitter and has explained his plans to hopefully reschedule CEO
    2020 to December of this year instead of June.
    According to Jebailey, 92% of those polled said that they would attend the yearly event if it is rescheduled to
    December. He's stated that he's currently working on the \"paperwork and hotel stuff\" in order to transition
    everything to later this year.
    A more formal announcement regarding the move will take place this Friday. Supposedly, there will be details on the
    lineup changing with the announcement.
    Jebailey has also mentioned that he's considering a schedule shift for CEOtaku this year too. This will likely be
    dependent on the state of the pandemic. As of right now, CEOtaku is scheduled to take place during the September
    25-27 weekend.
    Stay tuned for more information regarding details about registration and refunds. Of course, do keep in mind that
    things can be adjusted if the current situation with the COVID-19 pandemic changes."

    title: "Dogura's Seth is looking scary against Tokido's Akuma in this exciting Street Fighter 5: Champion Edition set"
    description: "CO|Dogura is known mainly for playing as M. Bison and Urien in Street Fighter 5, but it looks like in
    Street Fighter 5: Champion Edition he's been spending some time as the latest DLC character, Seth, as well. In a
    recent set of online games, Dogura's Seth went up against easily one of the best Street Fighter 5 players in the
    world, Rohto|Tokido, playing as his trademark Akuma. While Seth is still fairly undiscovered as a character,
    Dogura does a great job showing us more of the fighter's potential in these bouts."

    In a recent set of online games, Dogura's Seth went up against easily one of the best Street Fighter 5 players in
    the world, Rohto|Tokido, playing as his trademark Akuma. While Seth is still fairly undiscovered as a character,
    Dogura does a great job showing us more of the fighter's potential in these bouts.
    Seth is a character that wants to be in your face and typically has to counter and whiff punish the opponent to get
    there. Dogura's range with the boss character is fantastic, with several instances of being spaced out perfectly to
    tag Tokido's normals with a standing medium punch target combo confirm into a knockdown.
    Dogura opts to use V-Skill 1 in these matches, giving him the ability to reel Tokido in and put a big thorn in the
    side of his fireball game. As the set progresses, Tokido lowers the number of fireballs he throws from further out,
    and Dogura's read becomes strong enough to fire off a V-Skill when Tokido actually does try it and catch the start up.
    For those looking to learn more about Seth, these replays hold some important information about V-Trigger 2. Not
    only do we see a handful of tricky mix ups using the large orb, but there also appears to be a major counter
    employed by Tokido.
    There are several times where Dogura lands a target combo blockstring into his V-Trigger 2 activation, gets the orb
    out, then gets tagged by Tokido's V-Reversal. Each time, it looks like Tokido walks right back into the orb
    (that's behind him at this point), takes one hit, and sees the orb disappear making for what looks to be a viable
    strategy against the maneuver."
